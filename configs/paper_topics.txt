 1. Mathematical theories for transformers, deep learning, generative modeling, contractive learning, representation learning, large language models, and diffusion models, including approximation, optimization, and generalization theory, and new theoretical frameworks related to transformers, language models, and diffusion models. 
    - Relevant: theories for in-context learning, chain of thought, score estimation in diffusion models, sampling for diffusion models, GANs, VAEs, stochastic localization, optimization landscape, generalization error bounds. 
    - Not relevant: NA. 
 2. Experimental studies of transformers, contrastive learning, large language models, and diffusion models, including weight probing, model interpretation, mechanisms of neural networks, model editing, and emergent phenomenon. 
    - Relevant: mechanisms for in-context learning, chain of thought, diffusion models; new phenomenon in the training of neural networks; scaling laws. 
    - Not relevant: NA. 
 3. New methodologies for pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting of large language models, contrastive learning, and diffusion models, which improve accuracy, accelerate training, or safety measures. 
    - Relevant: new tokenization techniques, speculative decoding, flash attention, principled way of hyperparameter tuning, quantization, long context. 
    - Not relevant: NA. 
 4. New methodologies and applications for using large language model as agents, interacting with web browsers, file systems, calculators, and other APIs. 
    - Relevant: Prompting methods related to Chain of thought, ReAct, API calling. 
    - Not relevant: NA. 
 5. New methodological improvements to RLHF or instruction-following which are specific fine-tuning steps that are taken to make language models better at following user instructions across a range of tasks.
    - Relevant: papers that discuss specific methods like RLHF, or instruction-tuning datasets, improving these methods, or analyzing them. Usually these papers will explicitly mention RLHF, instruction-following or instruction-tuning.
    - Not relevant: papers about adaptation to some task. Simply following instructions or inputs are not sufficient.
 6. Describes new paradigms to evaluating open-ended text generation. Evaluating the outputs of language models is hard, especially in open-ended settings like for chatbots.
    - Relevant: papers that fundamentally rethink language model evaluation -- especially by accounting for subjectivity or using adversaries.
    - Not relevant: specific evaluations for specific tasks, identifying new properties or flaws of language models, or simply collecting new data.
 7. Conducts surveys or provides data into real-world usage and safety properties of language models.
    - Relevant: papers that create new datasets or surveys on real-world usage of language models.
    - Not relevant: papers that apply language models to new real-world tasks.
 8. New methodologies in large language models for Math about math prover and LEAN which improves accuracy, accelerate training, or math understanding. 
    - Relevant: LEAN, formal proof, self-play strategy, long chain of thought.
    - Not relevant: NA.



 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on statistical machine learning, and generative modeling in natural language processing.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical results in language models, as well as clever statistical tricks.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
